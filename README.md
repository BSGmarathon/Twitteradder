# Twitteradder

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

Install is easy :)

```bash
npm run build
```

## Prerequisites
You need a folder with "socialshit", and in it have
- `tweetData.rep` straight out of `NodeCG/db/replicants/speedcontrol-tweetr/tweetData.rep` after the schedule is in
- a Google Drive output of BSG's Twitter template, renamed to `csv.csv`
- TODO: Add template ^

Simply run the program with
```bash
node Twitteradder.js
```
and `output-tweetData.rep` gets made. rename this and paste it in the folder. Don't forget to restart nodecg.
